# IndigoCardGame
Create a fun game that you can play afterward. Refine your skills in using lists and Object-oriented programming. Test yourself to create an algorithm that provides competition to the players of the game.
In this project, you will create a simple card game called Indigo. It has simple rules, but it can also be the foundation for developing a more complex card game. You will create a virtual card deck and implement the game rules, scoring system, and a simple strategy for the program to compete against users.
